D208 Task 2: Predictive Modeling

Logistic regression is applied to predict hospital readmissions based on patients' health conditions.

**Research Question:** Can hospital readmissions be predicted using patient conditions (e.g., asthma, back pain)?

**Data Preparation:** Variables were converted to categorical data and cleaned to remove missing values. The dataset was split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

**Key Findings:** The reduced model (based on p-values) had an AIC of 9215.5 and achieved an accuracy of 52.5%, close to random guessing.

**Implications:** Logistic regression alone may not be effective for this prediction; further refinement or additional predictors are needed.

**Tools and Techniques:** Logistic regression modeling was performed in R, with evaluation metrics including AIC and accuracyâ€‹(Logistic Regression).
