D212 Task 1: Data Mining II

This project uses K-Means clustering to segment customers based on key characteristics to identify trends in service usage.

**Research Question:** How can income, tenure, bandwidth usage, and outage frequency be used to cluster customers?

**Data Preparation:** Variables were scaled after removing outliers and unnecessary columns. The silhouette method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

**Key Findings:** Two clusters were identified. New customers were associated with lower bandwidth usage, while long-term users had significantly higher usage.

**Implications:** Insights support tailored retention strategies and service optimization for different customer groups.

**Tools and Techniques:** R packages (factoextra, cluster) for clustering and visualizationâ€‹.
