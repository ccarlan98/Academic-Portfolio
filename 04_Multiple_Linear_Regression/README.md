D208 Task 1: Predictive Modeling

This project uses multiple linear regression to predict hospital charges based on patient demographics and treatment details.

**Research Question:** Can patient demographics and treatment details predict total medical charges?

**Data Preparation:** Data cleaning involved handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables. Multicollinearity issues were addressed by removing dependent predictors.

**Key Findings:** Significant predictors included age, initial hospital days, emergency admission, and complication risk, with the reduced model explaining 99.7% of the variability in charges.

**Implications:** Insights from this model can guide hospitals in understanding factors influencing patient billing.

**Tools and Techniques:** R was used for regression modeling and stepwise feature selection.
