D213 Task 1: Advanced Data Analytics

This project uses ARIMA modeling to forecast monthly revenue based on historical data.

**Research Question:** Can an ARIMA model accurately predict the next month of revenue?

**Data Preparation:** Data was cleaned and made stationary through differencing. Seasonal and trend components were analyzed.

**Key Findings:** The model forecasted revenue with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.77, indicating good fit, though fluctuations were not fully captured.

**Implications:** Short-term forecasts are reliable, but long-term predictions require further refinement.

**Tools and Techniques:** Python for time series modeling and ARIMA implementationâ€‹.
