D213 Task 2: Advanced Data Analytics

This project employs an LSTM neural network to classify sentiment in Amazon reviews as positive or negative.

**Research Question:** Can neural networks predict the sentiment of Amazon reviews with high accuracy?

**Data Preparation:** Data was preprocessed through tokenization, padding, and splitting into training, validation, and testing sets.

**Key Findings:** The model achieved 89.49% accuracy on the training set and 80.5% on the testing set, indicating good performance but slight overfitting.

**Implications:** Results demonstrate the efficacy of LSTMs for sentiment analysis, with potential applications in customer feedback evaluation.

**Tools and Techniques:** Python, TensorFlow, and Keras for neural network modelingâ€‹.
