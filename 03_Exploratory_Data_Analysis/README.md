D207: Exploratory Data Analysis

This folder investigates the relationship between pre-existing conditions and hospital readmissions through visual and statistical exploration.

**Research Question:** Do pre-existing conditions like diabetes or asthma affect the likelihood of hospital readmission?

**Data Preparation:** Data was cleaned and prepared for chi-square tests, with key variables like readmission and conditions analyzed for distribution.

**Key Findings:** The analysis revealed no significant relationship between specific conditions and readmissions (p-values > 0.05).

**Implications:** Hospitals should focus on generalized care rather than targeting specific conditions to reduce readmission rates.

**Tools and Techniques:** Chi-square tests and visualizations were created using R to examine categorical and continuous variables.
