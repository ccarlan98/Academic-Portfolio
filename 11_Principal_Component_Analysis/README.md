D212 Task 2: Data Mining II

This project uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and identify the most relevant variables in a healthcare dataset.

**Research Question:** What are the principal components within the medical dataset, and how much variance do they explain?

**Data Preparation:** Non-numeric and irrelevant variables were excluded. Remaining variables were normalized for PCA.

**Key Findings:** The first two components explained 53.6% of the variance. Variables such as total charges and initial hospital days had the greatest influence.

**Implications:** PCA simplifies the dataset while retaining significant information, making further analysis more efficient.

**Tools and Techniques:** R for covariance matrix analysis, scree plots, and PCA calculationâ€‹.
