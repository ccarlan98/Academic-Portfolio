D209 Task 1: Data Mining I

Naive Bayes classification is applied to predict hospital readmissions based on medical conditions.

**Research Question:** Can patient conditions predict the likelihood of hospital readmissions?

**Data Preparation:** The dataset was cleaned, categorical variables were encoded, and data was split into training and testing sets.

**Key Findings:** The model achieved an accuracy of 63% and an AUC of 0.5046, indicating poor predictive performance.

**Implications:** Current predictors do not provide significant insight into readmissions. Further data exploration is required.

**Tools and Techniques:** R packages (caret, pROC) were used for model development and evaluationâ€‹.
