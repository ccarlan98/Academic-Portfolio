D204: Data Acquisition 

This folder explores the process of acquiring and integrating data to investigate household characteristics influencing the preference for internet services.

**Research Question:** Are larger households (e.g., married with children) more likely to purchase fiber optic internet over DSL?

**Data Preparation:** Data from a PostgreSQL database and additional CSV files were integrated using SQL queries. Columns were filtered, joined, and transformed to align with the research question.

**Key Findings:** The analysis found no significant preference for fiber optic among larger households. DSL remained the most popular service across all groups.

**Implications:** These findings suggest potential opportunities for targeted marketing strategies to promote fiber optic internet services.

**Tools and Techniques:** SQL in PGAdmin4 was used for table creation, data joining, and filtering, supported by logical data modeling.
