D210: Reporting and Representation

This project demonstrates the creation of an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze healthcare data.

**Research Question:** How can healthcare trends in readmissions and charges be visualized by zip code and state?

**Data Preparation:** Data from multiple sources was joined in Tableau, with filters applied to refine metrics by zip code, income, and charges.

**Key Findings:** No significant correlation was found between income levels and readmissions. Average charges varied marginally between states and zip codes.

**Implications:** Dashboards provide actionable insights for healthcare decision-makers.

**Tools and Techniques:** Tableau for interactive dashboards, custom SQL queries for data integrationâ€‹.
