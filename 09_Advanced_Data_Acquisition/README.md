D211: Advanced Data Acquisition

This project integrates advanced data acquisition techniques with reporting to analyze hospital readmissions and healthcare costs by geographic area.

**Research Question:** How do readmission rates and hospital charges vary by zip code, particularly in relation to income levels below the federal poverty line?

**Data Preparation:** The dataset from PGAdmin4 was joined with population data using SQL queries. Fields were renamed and cleaned to remove irrelevant columns and duplicates. Custom SQL queries were used directly within Tableau for dynamic visualizations.

**Key Findings:** No significant correlation was found between income and readmission rates or charges. Average charges were uniformly distributed across zip codes.

**Implications:** Results can guide healthcare resource allocation and financial assistance programs.

**Tools and Techniques:** PGAdmin4 for data manipulation, Tableau for reporting and visualizationâ€‹.
