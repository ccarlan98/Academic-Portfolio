**Key Findings:** A strong relationship was observed between certain drug combinations, such as "combo" and "salt," with high lift values indicating strong association.

**Implications:** Findings support inventory management and further research into drug safety.

**Tools and Techniques:** R for transaction transformation and association rule miningâ€‹.
