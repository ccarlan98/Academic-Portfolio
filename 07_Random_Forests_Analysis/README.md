D209 Task 2: Data Mining I

This project uses the Random Forest algorithm to predict hospital readmissions based on survey responses.

**Research Question:** Can hospital readmissions be predicted using patient survey responses?

**Data Preparation:** The dataset was cleaned, variables renamed for clarity, and target variables were converted for analysis. Data was split into training and testing sets.

**Key Findings:** The model achieved an accuracy of 60.6% and an AUC of 0.4916, suggesting limited predictive ability.

**Implications:** Survey responses alone are insufficient for accurate readmission prediction; additional data is needed.

**Tools and Techniques:** R was used for Random Forest modeling and evaluation, with metrics including confusion matrix and AUCâ€‹.
